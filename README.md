# recamera-rs

A Rust SDK for Seeed reCamera -- camera capture, local inference, serial I/O, storage, and system utilities for edge vision applications.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a community project and is not affiliated with or officially maintained by Seeed Studio.

## Usage

Add `recamera` to your `Cargo.toml` with the features you need:

```toml
[dependencies]
recamera = { version = "0.1", features = ["uart", "storage"] }
```

To enable everything:

```toml
[dependencies]
recamera = { version = "0.1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Feature Flags

| `infer`   | Local inference engine (.cvimodel)       | No      |
| `uart`    | UART / serial communication              | No      |

## Status

This project is at an early stage. The API is expected to change as the design stabilizes.

- Pure-Rust crates (`core`, `uart`, `rs485`, `storage`, `logging`, `config`, `system`) are functional.
- FFI crates (`camera`, `infer`, `cvi-sys`) are scaffolded but pending real bindings against the CVI runtime libraries.

## Generating FFI Bindings

The `camera` and `infer` features require FFI bindings for the SG2002 vendor C libraries. Pre-generated bindings are committed to the repo, but if you need to regenerate them:

1. Download the SDK tarball from [reCamera-OS releases](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/reCamera-OS/releases) (look for `*_sdk.tar.gz`) and extract it. Alternatively, clone the [Milk-V Duo SDK](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk).

2. Install bindgen:
   ```sh
   cargo install bindgen-cli
   ```

3. Run the generation script:
   ```sh
   SDK_PATH=/path/to/sg2002_recamera_emmc ./scripts/generate-bindings.sh
   ```

4. Verify and commit:
   ```sh
   cargo check -p recamera-cvi-sys
   git add crates/recamera-cvi-sys/src/bindings.rs
   git commit -m "feat: update FFI bindings"
   ```

The script auto-detects both the reCamera-OS SDK and Milk-V Duo SDK layouts.

## Cross-Compilation

reCamera uses the SG2002 SoC (RISC-V 64-bit). To cross-compile:

```sh
# Install the target
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-linux-musl

# Build (set SG200X_SDK_PATH to the SDK sysroot for camera/infer linking)
export SG200X_SDK_PATH=/path/to/sg2002_recamera_emmc
cargo build --target riscv64gc-unknown-linux-musl --release
```

Pure-Rust crates (uart, storage, logging, config, system) can be cross-compiled without the SDK.
